Here's a step-by-step guide for managing users and roles in Jenkins for GitHub integration:

**Step 1: Access Jenkins**
- Open your web browser and navigate to the Jenkins login page: http://ip:8080

**Step 2: Log In**
- Enter your username and password to log in to Jenkins with administrative privileges.

**Step 3: Create New User**
- Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Users → Create User.
- Enter the user name, password, full name, and email address.
- Click the "Create User" button.

**Step 4: Configure Users**
- After logging in, you may see the user's name in the upper right corner of Jenkins.
- Click "Configure" on the user's drop-down menu.
- On the configuration page, update the description, add new API tokens, password, terminal sessions, and define time zones.

**Step 5: Download and Install Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin**
- Go to Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Available plugins.
- Search for "Role" in the search box.
- In the dropdown list, select "Role-based Authentication Strategy" plugin.
- Click "Install without restart" to install the plugin.

**Step 6: Change Authorization to Role-based Strategy**
- After successful installation, go to Manage Jenkins → Security.
- Select "Role-Based Strategy" under the Authorization section.
- Click "Apply" and then "Save."

**Step 7: Creating Roles and Granting Privileges**
- Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles.
- You have three options: "Manage Roles," "Assign Roles," and "Role Strategy Macros."
- Click "Manage Roles" to view existing roles.
- Create a new role, e.g., "Employee," for global access and define permissions (e.g., read, view).

**Step 8: Assigning Roles to Users**
- Go to Manage Jenkins → Manage and Assign Roles → Assign Roles.
- For global roles, add users (e.g., aashish and naba) and assign the "Employee" role to them.
- For project roles, add users (e.g., aashish and naba) and assign roles like "Developer" and "QA."

**Step 9: Create Different Projects to Test Roles**
- Create test projects to check user access.
- Go to Jenkins Dashboard → New Item → Create freestyle projects (e.g., devproj1 and testproj1).
- Log in as a user with assigned roles to see the projects they have access to.

**Step 10: Verify Access**
- Log in as aashish (Developer) user to verify their access.
- Log in as naba (QA) user to verify their access.
- For new users without assigned roles, access should be denied.

This guide helps you manage users and roles in Jenkins for GitHub integration, ensuring proper access control and permissions.
